Paragraph describing the problem that your project is solving  
Students often waste time searching for open study rooms on campus. Availability information is scattered across unreliable sources like outdated calendars, handwritten signs, or word of mouth. This leads to frustration, missed study opportunities, and conflicts when groups double-book the same room. Our project, called StudyRoom Finder, solves this issue by centralizing room schedules and occupancy updates in one simple Java application. As part of development, we implemented secure password validation to ensure only authorized users can check in or update room status. The app imports campus timetables, lets users check in/out of rooms, and highlights available or soon-to-be-open spaces. With one accurate view of current and upcoming availability, the project reduces wasted time, prevents scheduling conflicts, and helps students plan effective study sessions.

Password Validator pseudocode: Allows for user input. Prompts the user to enter a password and stores it in a variable. Checks if the password is valid using the "isValidPassword" function. Prints a message that tells the user whether their password is strong or not. Finally, it closes the scanner.

Created a Dockerfile for IS147Test1 to allow for building and running IS147Test1 in a containerized environment. This creates a more organized project.  

Modified Dockerfile from Task #3 to allow for github workflow. Created Github Action uing Github UI. Dorcas committed and pushed her changes to trigger the GitHub Action.
