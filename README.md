Paragraph describing the problem that your project is solving  
Students often waste time searching for open study rooms on campus. Availability information is scattered across unreliable sources like outdated calendars, handwritten signs, or word of mouth. This leads to frustration, missed study opportunities, and conflicts when groups double-book the same room. Our project, called StudyRoom Finder, solves this issue by centralizing room schedules and occupancy updates in one simple Java application. The app imports campus timetables, lets users check in/out of rooms, and highlights available or soon-to-be-open spaces. With one accurate view of current and upcoming availability, the project reduces wasted time, prevents scheduling conflicts, and helps students plan effective study sessions.
